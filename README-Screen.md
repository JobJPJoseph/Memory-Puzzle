## Tasks
    We need to make an grid. However, we are not going to use arrays but use a Hash Table to create this grid. This will allow us to save time at the cost of space. We will use the coordinates as keys and letters as values. In total for Each letter should appear twice in the object.

    1. Create a Hash Table called `realCoordinates`.
    2. Create a Hash Table called `printedCoordinates`.
    3. Should a create method called `fillGrid`
    4. Create a constructor. This here is to set up the important data of the project.
